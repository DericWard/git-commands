    <h3>Initial set up of GIT:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>git <strong>--version</strong> - will show whether GIT is installed, if not Install GIT* then continue with
            this list.</li>
        <li>git <strong>config --global user.name</strong> "yourname" - as on GitHub without spaces between fore and
            surnames".</li>
        <li>git <strong>config --global user.email</strong> "your.email" - the email address you used for your GitHub
            account.</li>
        <li>git <strong>--global color.ui auto</strong> - automatically color different UI elements.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>

    <h3>Project/repo directory set up:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>mkdir 'directory/repo name' - creates a directory/repo</li>
        <li>cd 'directory/repo name' - move into the newly created directory</li>
        <li>git <strong>init .</strong> - initialise GIT in this directory and its sub-directories.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>rm -rf .git</strong> - remove a directory/repo from git (disable git in this repo)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h3>Once you have created, and perhaps added content to, your files you move to the <strong>staging</strong> stage
        of the GIT
        workflow:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>git <strong>status</strong> - shows you which files have been added for staging and those which are not.
        </li>
        <li>git <strong>add</strong> 'file name(s)' - adds files for staging - multiple files require a space between
            each file name</li>
        <li>git <strong>add .</strong> - adds ALL files in this directory and its sub-directories for staging.</li>
        <h4>Note: Adding all files with 'git add .' only works 'downwards' through a directory tree/structure - if you
            are working in a
            sub-directory and issue a 'git add .' command it will NOT add files that are 'above' the directory you are
            working in. E.g. files located in any parent directories will NOT be added to staging. To overcome this:
        </h4>
        <li>git <strong>add . -A</strong> - this will stage files from the current directory and its child directories
            as well as from its parent directory.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>git <strong>rm --cached 'filename(s)'</strong> - removes files from staging, if you've made a mistake or
            changes.</li>
        <li>git <strong>rm -r --cached .</strong> - removes ALL currently staged files from staging.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h3>When you've staged all the files you want, move to the <strong>commit</strong> stage of the GIT workflow:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>git <strong>commit -m </strong>"message - why you are performing this commit" - sends the staged file(s) for
            commit</li>
        <h4>Note: Amend the commit message, if required, by issuing the following command:</h4>
        <li>git <strong>commit --amend -m</strong> "your amended message" - this will replace the original message.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>git <strong>restore</strong> 'filename' - removes the file 'filename' from the commit.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
